          JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the
          world. I believe it's a great language to be your first programming
          language ever. We mainly use JavaScript to create
          <ul>
            <li>websites</li>
            <li>web applications</li>
            <li>server-side applications using Node.js</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            but JavaScript is not limited to these things, and it can also be
            used to
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>create mobile applications using tools like React Native</li>
            <li>
              create programs for microcontrollers and the internet of things
            </li>
            <li>create smartwatch applications</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It can basically do anything. It's so popular that everything new
            that shows up is going to have some kind of JavaScript integration
            at some point.

        <header>Variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            A variable is a value assigned to an identifier, so you can
            reference and use it later in the program.
          </p>
          <p>
            is because JavaScript is loosely typed, a concept you'll frequently
            hear about.
          </p>
          <p>A variable must be declared before you can use it.</p>
          <p>
            We have 2 main ways to declare variables. The first is to use const
            :
          </p>
          <code>const a = 0</code>
          <p>The second way is to use let :</p>
          <code>let a = 0</code>
          <p>What's the difference?</p>
          <p>
            defines a constant reference to a value. This means the reference
            cannot be changed. You cannot reassign a new value to it.
          </p>
          <p>Using let you can assign a new value to it.</p>
          <p>For example, you cannot do this:</p>
          <code>onst a = 0</code>
          <code>a = 1</code>
          <p>
            Because you'll get an error: TypeError: Assignment to constant
            variable.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, you can do it using let :</p>
          <code>let a = 0</code>
          <code>a = 1</code>
        </article>

      <section id="Arrays" class="main-section">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <article>
          <p>An array is a collection of elements.</p>
          <p>Arrays in JavaScript are not a type on their own.</p>
          <p>Arrays are objects.</p>
          <p>We can initialize an empty array in these 2 different ways:</p>
          <code>
            const a = []<br />
            const a = Array()<br />
          </code>
          <p>
            The first is using the array literal syntax. The second uses the
            Array built- in function.
          </p>
          <p>You can pre-fill the array using this syntax:</p>
          <code>
            const a = [1, 2, 3]<br />
            const a = Array.of(1, 2, 3)
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section id="Objects" class="main-section">
        <header>Objects</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Any value that's not of a primitive type (a string, a number, a
            boolean, a symbol, null, or undefined) is an object.
          </p>
          <p>Here's how we define an object:</p>
          <code>const car = {}</code>
          <p>
            This is the object literal syntax, which is one of the nicest things
            in JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>You can also use the new Object syntax:</p>
          <code>const car = new Object()</code>
          <p>Another syntax is to use Object.create() :</p>
          <code>const car = Object.create()</code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In any moderately complex JavaScript program, everything happens
            inside functions.
          </p>
          <p>Functions are a core, essential part of JavaScript.</p>
          <p>What is a function?</p>
          <p>A function is a block of code, self-contained.</p>
          <p>Here's a function declaration:</p>
          <code>
            function getData() {<br />
            // do something<br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            A function can be run any time you want by invoking it, like this:
          </p>
          <code>getData()</code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section id="Value" class="main-section">
        <header>Value</header>
        <article>
          <p>A hello string is a value. A number like 12 is a value.</p>
          <p>
            hello and 12 are values. string and number are the types of those
            values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The type is the kind of value, its category. We have many different
            types in JavaScript, and we'll talk about them in detail later on.
            Each type has its own characteristics.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we need to have a reference to a value, we assign it to a
            variable. The variable can have a name, and the value is what's
            stored in a variable, so we can later access that value through the
            variable name.
          </p>

      <section id="Operators" class="main-section">
        <header>Operators</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Operators allow you to get two simple expressions and combine them
            to form a more complex expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can classify operators based on the operands they work with. Some
            operators work with 1 operand. Most with 2 operands. Just one
            operator works with 3 operands.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can classify operators based on the operands they work with. Some
            In this first introduction to operators, we'll introduce the
            operators you are most likely familiar with: binary operators.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can classify operators based on the operands they work with. Some
            I already introduced one when talking about variables: the
            assignment operator = . You use = to assign a value to a variable:
          </p>
          <code>let b = 2</code>
          <p>
            We can classify operators based on the operands they work with. Some
            Let's now introduce another set of binary operators that you are
            already familiar with, from basic math.

      <section id="Conditional_Statement" class="main-section">
        <header>Conditional Statement</header>
        <article class="indent">
          <h3>If</h3>
          <p>
            An if statement is used to make the program take a route, or
            another, depending on the result of an expression evaluation.
          </p>
          <p>This is the simplest example, which always executes:</p>
          <code>
            if (true) {<br />
            //do something<br />
            }
          </code>
          <code>
            on the contrary, this is never executed:<br />
            if (false) {<br />
            //do something (? never ?)<br />
            }
          </code>

          <h3>Else</h3>
          <p>You can provide a second part to the if statement: else.</p>
          <p>
            You attach a statement that is going to be executed if the if
            condition is
          </p>
          <code>
            false:<br />
            if (true) {<br />
            //do something<br />
            } else {<br />
            //do something else<br />
            }

      <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <article>
          <p>Loops are one of the main control structures of JavaScript.</p>
          <p>
            With a loop we can automate and repeat indefinitely a block of code,
            for how many times we want it to run.
          </p>
          <p>JavaScript provides many ways to iterate through loops.</p>
          <p>I want to focus on 3 ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>while loops</li>
            <li>for loops</li>
            <li>for..of loops</li>

      <section id="Classes" class="main-section">
        <header>Classes</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            What are classes? They are a way to define a common pattern for
            multiple objects.
          </p>
          <p>Let's take a person object:</p>
          <code>
            const person = {<br />
            name: 'Flavio',<br />
            }
          </code>
          <code>
            We can create a class named Person (note the capital P , a
            convention<br />
            when using classes), that has a name property:<br />
            class Person {<br />
            name<br />
            }<br />
          </code>

      <section id="Arrow_Function" class="main-section">
        <header>Arrow Function</header>
        <article>
          <p>Arrow functions are a recent introduction to JavaScript.</p>
          <p>
            They are very often used instead of "regular" functions, the one I
            described in the previous chapter. You'll find both forms used
            everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visually, they allow you to write functions with a shorter syntax,
            from:
          </p>
          <code>
            function getData() {<br />
            //...<br />
            }<br />
            to<br />
            ;() => {<br />
            //...<br />
            }
          </code>
